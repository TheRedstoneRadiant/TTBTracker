# TTBTracker
Discord Bot which scrapes information from the TTB UofT database and alerts to vacancies in courses. By utilizing the same requests which https://https://ttb.utoronto.ca/ sends out, this bot is able to track open spots in classes and DM individuals looking to enroll/swap positions in a course without losing their current spot
